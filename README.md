# Study_Mate 
This is the first project created by my team during our first-ever hackathon in college, called Hackwave. As freshmen, we didn't have much knowledge about how hackathons work but came up with a small idea called "Study Mate."

The main goal was to provide each student with a unique, ready-made timetable based on their academic calendar and personal flexibility. We aimed to specifically tailor each timetable according to the studentâ€™s difficulty ranking of subjects.

Currently, our project is in its early stages, where we have completed the frontend of our idea. There is still much to develop and add!
